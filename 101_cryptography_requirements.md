## Release Signoff Checklist

<!--
**ACTION REQUIRED:** In order to merge code into a release, there must be an
issue in [keylime/enhancements] referencing this enhancement and targeting a release**.

For enhancements that make changes to code or processes/procedures in core
Keylime i.e., [keylime/keylime], we require the following Release
Signoff checklist to be completed.

Check these off as they are completed for the Release Team to track. These
checklist items _must_ be updated for the enhancement to be released.
-->

- [ ] Enhancement issue in release milestone, which links to pull request in [keylime/enhancements]
- [ ] Core members have approved the issue with the label `implementable`
- [ ] Design details are appropriately documented
- [ ] Test plan is in place
- [ ] User-facing documentation has been created in [keylime/keylime-docs]


## Summary

In order to support IDevID and IAK within Keylime we must enable the use of RSA-PSS [1]. In order to be able to verify RSA-PSS signatures, the salt length needs to be extracted from the signature. This should be done using the AUTO attribute for salt_length, which was added to the cryptography package in version 37.0.0 [2]

[1] TPM 2.0 Keys for Device Identity and Attestation https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/TPM-2p0-Keys-for-Device-Identity-and-Attestation_v1_r12_pub10082021.pdf
[2] PSS signature scheme in the cyptography library https://cryptography.io/en/latest/hazmat/primitives/asymmetric/rsa/#cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.padding.PSS

## Motivation

Enable RSA-PSS signature scheme verification in Keylime to enable compatibility with IAKs and IDevIDs.

### Goals

Require cryptogrraphy >= 37.0.0

### Non-Goals

<!--
What is out of scope for this enhancement?  Listing non-goals helps to focus discussion
and make progress.
-->

## Proposal

Require cryptogrraphy >= 37.0.0

### User Stories (optional)

<!--
Detail the things that people will be able to do if this enhancement is implemented.
Include as much detail as possible so that people can understand the "how" of
the system.  The goal here is to make this feel real for users without getting
bogged down.
-->

#### Story 1

#### Story 2

### Notes/Constraints/Caveats (optional)

<!--
What are the caveats to the proposal?
What are some important details that didn't come across above.
Go in to as much detail as necessary here.
This might be a good place to talk about core concepts and how they relate.
-->

### Risks and Mitigations

<!--
What are the risks of this proposal and how do we mitigate.  Think broadly.
For example, consider both security and how this will impact the larger
enhancement ecosystem.

How will security be reviewed and by whom?
-->

## Design Details

<!--
This section should contain enough information that the specifics of your
change are understandable.  This may include API specs (though not always
required) or even code snippets.  If there's any ambiguity about HOW your
proposal will be implemented, this is the place to discuss them.
-->

### Test Plan

<!--
**Note:** *Not required until targeted at a release.*

Consider the following in developing a test plan for this enhancement:
- Will there be e2e and integration tests, in addition to unit tests?
- How will it be tested in isolation vs with other components?

No need to outline all of the test cases, just the general strategy.  Anything
that would count as tricky in the implementation and anything particularly
challenging to test should be called out.

All code is expected to have adequate tests (eventually with coverage
expectations).
-->

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

<!--
If applicable, how will the component be upgraded and downgraded? Make sure
this is in the test plan.

Consider the following in developing an upgrade/downgrade strategy for this enhancement
-->

### Dependencie requirements

<!--
If your new change requires new dependencies, please outline and demonstrate that your selected dependency 
is well maintained and packaged in Keylime's supported Operating Systems (currently Debian Stable
and as of time writing Fedora 32/33). 

During code implementation you will also be expected to add the package to CI , the keylime ansible role and 
keylimes main installer (`keylime/installers.sh`).

If the package is not available in the supported Operated systems, the PR will not be merged into master. 

Adding the package in `requirements.txt` is not sufficent for master which is where we tag releases from. 

You may however be able to work within an experimental branch until a package is made available. If this is
the case, please outline it in this enhancement.

-->

## Drawbacks

<!--
Why should this enhancement _not_ be implemented?
-->

## Alternatives

<!--
What other approaches did you consider and why did you rule them out?  These do
not need to be as detailed as the proposal, but should include enough
information to express the idea and why it was not acceptable.
-->

## Infrastructure Needed (optional)

<!--
Use this section if you need things infrastructure related specific to your enhancement.  Examples include a
new subproject, repos requested, github webhook, changes to CI (travis).
